# `springerQuarantineBooksR`: download all Springer books made available during the COVID-19 quarantine

**"With the Coronavirus outbreak having an unprecedented impact on education, Springer Nature is launching a global program to support learning and teaching at higher education institutions worldwide."**

This package has the `download_springer_book_files` function which can be used to download all (or a subset) of these Springer book files freely available. Currently, it fetches only the epub versions of the books and generates a repo with 7.27GB, if all books are downloaded.

*This is still a work in progress. Thus, any help and/or feedbacks are welcome!*

## Installation

Assuming you have [devtools](https://github.com/r-lib/devtools) installed, you can install `springerQuarantineBooksR` with the following code (you might also try `force = T` argument inside `install_github` function):

```
devtools::install_github("renanxcortes/springerQuarantineBooksR")
library(springerQuarantineBooksR)
```

## Download all books in any repo of your choice:

```
setwd('path_of_your_choice')
download_springer_book_files()
```

You'll get an output similar like this:

## Repo Structure generated

It will be generated a repo named `springer_quarantine_books` with a specific structure:

![](inst/extdata/directory_org_example.png)

## Download only specific books:

For example, if you'd like to download only books with "Data Science" on the title, you can run:

```	
springer_table <- download_springer_table()

specific_titles_list <- springer_table %>% 
  filter(str_detect(book_title, 'Data Science')) %>% 
  pull(book_title)

download_springer_book_files(springer_books_titles = specific_titles_list)
```
